# Nibrosuite for Roll20

Nibrodooh's collection of Mod's for playing Pathfinder 2e on Roll20. These scripts are pretty rough as they are just my quick and dirty methods of getting things working to play the game.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To build:

```bash
bun start
```

This will build the script and copy it to your clipboard to be pasted into the Roll20 mod page.
